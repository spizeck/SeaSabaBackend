# Backend for Group Contract Builder

This project is the backend for a Group Contract Builder application, built using FastAPI. It manages complex data models, including Hotels, Room Types, Occupancy Rates, Room Rates, Meal Options, Seasons, Diving Packages, Special Offers, Booking Policies, and Group Contracts.

## Project Structure

The backend project is structured as follows:

- `app/`: Main application folder.
  - `users/`: User-related modules.
  - `contracts/`: Contract-related modules.
  - `core/`: Core application modules.
    - `config/`: Configuration settings.
    - `security/`: Security and authentication.
  - `db/`: Database-related modules.
    - `base_class/`: Base class for SQLAlchemy models.
    - `session/`: Database session management.
  - `dependencies.py`: Dependencies for FastAPI routes.
  - `main.py`: Main FastAPI application file.
- `tests/`: Test cases for the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/spizeck/SeaSabaBackend```
2. Navigate to the backend directory: ```cd path/to/backend```
3. Install the required packages: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

   
### Running the Development Server

To start the FastAPI development server, run: ```uvicorn app.main:app --reload```

The `--reload` flag enables auto-reloading of the server upon changes to the code.

### Accessing the API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the API documentation (auto-generated by FastAPI) by navigating to:

`http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Data Model Visualization

To help visualize the relationships between different entities in our application, we have created a Mermaid chart. This chart illustrates how various models like `Hotel`, `RoomType`, `OccupancyRate`, `RoomRate`, `MealOption`, `Season`, `DivingPackage`, `SpecialOffer`, `BookingPolicy`, and `GroupContract` are interconnected. It serves as a useful reference for understanding the structure and relations of our data models.

### Mermaid Chart

Below is the Mermaid chart showing the relationships among our models:

      +String name

    }
    class RoomType {
      +String name
      +Integer number_of_rooms
    }
    class OccupancyRate {
      +String occupancy_type
      +Float rate
